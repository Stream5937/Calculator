Project notes
Difficulty getting initial browser window to open to the size desired especially if running in a window tab
so my workaround:
	Intiate the calculator by running Calculator.html
	this just opens directly a new pop-up browser window calc.html 
	to my desired size at my desired screen coords
	then promptly shuts its self down so is not seen.
	All action then resolves around calc.html
	 
Handle input basic work flow:-

function btnClicked(id){} react to buttons and segregate to:-
	//handle numeric input
	//handle header buttons			IMPLEMENT LATER IF EVER
	//handle input moderation		//clr del and sign
	//handle maths operations
	
//handle numeric input
	determine basic flow as 	enter a number ensuring it is first number
					  restrict to max value?	-> relationship to max val of output?
					  permit decimal point
					  ensure max 1 decimal point ?
					  ensure max 1 decimal place ?
					  permit sign change
					  permit delete & repeat as first number
					ensure next is an operator 
					if operator demands second number
					enter a number ensuring it is second number
					  restrict to max value?	-> relationship to max val of output?
					  ensure max 1 decimal point ?
					  ensure max 1 decimal place ?
					  permit sign change
					  permit delete & repeat as second number
					based on operator call appropriate function

isolated functions 
	clear input values
	clear input display
	clear history values
	clear history display
	copy valid inputs to history
	set up local storage for history and undo functions   -> unnecessary!
	
////////////   ISSUES   //////////////
issues with content display, sign and decimals plus history display -> ok done
make font smaller when display area exceeded -> ok done
deal with calculation overflow issue -> ok done
set content display right justified? -> ok done
display of first disappears when second sign changed -> oK re-done 
clear content display if another number entered after result before an operator -> ok done (repeated below) 
display decimal point as entered not wait for next number-> OK Done
error in allowing two numbers entered following result - without operator -> ok done
division by zero error-> ok done ?
need to correct display when changing sign of second number -> ok done
action of last character delete
entering num op num op should show error or just give result

deal with enter = before operator error -> ok done
