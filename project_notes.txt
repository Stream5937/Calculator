Project notes
Difficulty getting initial browser window to open to the size desired especially if running in a window tab
so my workaround:
	Intiate the calculator by running Calculator.html
	this just opens directly a new pop-up browser window calc.html 
	to my desired size at my desired screen coords
	then promptly shuts its self down so is not seen.
	All action then resolves around calc.html
